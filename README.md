# Disease Surveillance App

## Introduction

I wish to improve a disease surveillance system for COVID-19 which will remain anonymous for now, until I can figure out some legal stuff.

## Changes needed
- Save button at every section so outbreak investigators won't have to scroll
- Use USPS API which will help to automatically populate the county
- Script used by case investigators to talk to cases embedded in the application 
- Tag/flag for important issues (ex. case in the hospital)
- Automatically pull up infection control docs
- I don't like the way it saves contacts (I wish I could just directly write it in like everytihg else)
- I don't like how currently, when I save everything, I have to click edit to keep editing the document
- Sort at the top
- Filter and sort needs to be seperate or more organized
- County where located and county where tested would be able to be searched for seperately
- Be able to search by phone number and pretty much everything
- I wonder why it crashes so often. A fellow disease investigator told me that it doesn't crash if you put in distrcts but that is so false
- Patient information and physician info should be visually seperate
- A form/input about each interaction with the patient
  + Left Voicemail
  + No answer
  + Busy Signal
  + Texting
- Should be able to write in more than one phone number for patient and their emergency contact
